## Description

For this website we wanted to create a neat, clean site where users could see a list of asteroids near earth at the present time, and if they create a user account, then they can view specific details about each asteroid and leave comments on them. In making this project, we learned more about API routes, sequelize queries to a MySQL database, and using handlebars to facilitate server-side rendering for all of the pages. It uses a NASA API to bring in the asteroid data, and then uses a back-end MySQL database to store the asteroid data, comments, and user data. Each page is rendered using handlebars on the server.

## Future Developments

Here is a list of potential future developments:

    - Create a thumbs-up option for each asteroid.
    - Allow users to "match" over asteroids that they have reacted positively to.
